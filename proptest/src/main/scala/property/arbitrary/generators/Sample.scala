/**
 * A trait representing a sample value along with its possible shrinks.
 *
 * The `Sample` trait encapsulates a value of type `T` and provides a method to retrieve its shrink tree (`RTree[T]`).
 * Shrinking is a technique used in property-based testing to find simpler or smaller failing cases when a test fails.
 * The `shrinks` method returns an `RTree` that starts from the given value, allowing exploration of alternative
 * versions of the value that are simpler.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the value being encapsulated.
 * @param value The generated value of type `T`.
 * @example
 * {{{
 *   val sample = new Sample {}
 *   println(sample.value)    // Outputs: 42
 *   println(sample.shrinks)  // Outputs: RTree starting with value 42
 * }}}
